# Procedural Fish Animation

This project is a simple 2D procedural animation of a fish using inverse kinematics (IK). The fish follows the mouse cursor smoothly, with its body and fins dynamically adjusting to the movement.

## Features
- **Procedural Animation**: The fish's body and fins move dynamically based on the mouse position.
- **Smooth Movement**: The fish follows the mouse cursor with a slight offset to avoid snapping.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the fish's size, speed, and behavior by modifying the code.

## How It Works
The fish is composed of a chain of joints, and its movement is controlled using inverse kinematics. The head of the fish follows the mouse cursor, while the rest of the body smoothly adjusts to maintain a natural flow.
